                        <p class="mb-4 tm-intro-text">
                          In this literature survey, the focus is on the significance of sign language, particularly Sinhala Sign Language
                          (SSL), as a primary mode of communication for individuals with hearing impairment. It's noted that sign languages like
                          SSL are intricate, visual, and gestural systems with their own distinct syntax and vocabulary, comprising a vast and
                          nuanced lexicon of unique signs. However, a notable challenge exists in the form of insufficient resources and
                          standardized learning materials for SSL. This lack of available resources means that while SSL is understandable to
                          those who are familiar with it, it remains largely unintelligible to individuals who are not acquainted with this
                          particular language. Various initiatives have been undertaken to address this gap and enhance the accessibility of SSL
                          for all.

                        <h3 class="tm-text-primary mb-4">Research Problem</h3>
                        <p class="mb-4 tm-intro-text">
                          Sign language serves as a crucial mode of communication for individuals with hearing impairments in Sri Lanka,
                          particularly through Sinhala Sign Language. This report identifies four primary research problems in the context of
                          Sinhala Sign Language learning, with the aim of addressing these challenges:
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                          <li><b>Lack of Standardized Learning System:</b> One of the most significant issues in Sinhala Sign Language learning
                            is the absence of a standardized system or curriculum. There is no universally accepted framework for teaching and
                            learning Sinhala Sign Language. This lack of standardization hampers the quality of education and makes it
                            challenging to accurately assess the proficiency of individuals in Sinhala Sign Language.</li>
                        
                          <li><b>Concentration of Training Centers in Colombo:</b> The majority of Sinhala Sign Language training centers are
                            situated in Colombo, the capital city. This geographical concentration creates a substantial barrier for individuals
                            living in rural areas who aspire to learn Sinhala Sign Language. Rural residents face multiple challenges in
                            accessing these centers, including high travel costs, time constraints, and limited availability of resources. The
                            lack of accessibility exacerbates the urban-rural divide in sign language education.</li>
                          <li><b>Limited Learning Opportunities for Rural Residents:</b>Due to the absence of training centers in rural areas,
                            people residing in these regions have limited opportunities to learn Sinhala Sign Language. This inequality in
                            access to education puts rural residents with hearing impairments at a considerable disadvantage. They miss out on
                            vital communication skills, hindering their ability to interact with the broader community and access educational
                            and employment opportunities.</li>
                          <li><b>Communication Difficulties for Students in Schools:</b>Deaf students from rural areas who manage to attend
                            schools or institutions for the deaf often encounter communication difficulties. These students may have learned
                            sign language informally or may not have had access to comprehensive sign language education. The lack of
                            standardized sign language education results in communication challenges within the school environment, impacting
                            their ability to fully engage in educational activities and social interactions.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3 class="tm-text-primary mb-4">Research Objectives</h3>
                        <h4 class="tm-text-primary mb-4">Main Objective</h4>
                        <p>The central aim of this project is to design and develop a web application that serves as a transformative tool for
                          individuals with hearing impairments. This online application has a core mission: to close the communication gap that
                          often separates the hearing-impaired community from the broader population, thereby enhancing their overall quality of
                          life. By offering innovative solutions, the application is dedicated to fostering meaningful interactions and
                          inclusion for the hearing-impaired population, enabling them to participate more fully in society.</p>

                        <h4 class="tm-text-primary">Sub Objective</h4>
                        <ul>
                          <li>Develop a Web Application for Sign Language Recognition</li>
                          <li>Implement a Web Application for Cochlear-Implanted Children</li>
                          <li>Create a Web Application for Learning Sign Language</li>
                          <li>Develop a Web Application for Video and Audio Conversion into Signs</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3 class="tm-text-primary mb-4">Methodology</h3>
                        <p>The research project utilizes a versatile technology stack, featuring React.js for the frontend and a combination of Spring Boot and Flask for the backend, to create an innovative and inclusive Sinhala Sign Language learning and interpretation system. The frontend, developed with React.js, offers a responsive and flexible interface for users to access various learning materials. The backend services are divided between Spring Boot, responsible for user authentication, database interactions, and overall system integrity, and Flask, which integrates machine learning models to interpret sign language gestures in real-time, generate dynamic quizzes, and convert audio/video inputs into Sinhala Sign Language translations. This comprehensive approach ensures seamless user experiences, incorporating interactive learning modules, quizzes, and vocal training exercises, making the system accessible and supportive for both learners and individuals seeking sign language interpretation services. Through the integration of advanced technology, this project bridges communication gaps, promotes inclusivity, and enhances language comprehension and pronunciation skills for users, ultimately contributing to a more accessible and inclusive society.</p>
                        <h3 class="tm-text-primary mb-4">Research Gap</h3>
                        <p>One prominent gap in the existing research landscape is the absence of instruction or lessons on basic Sinhala phrases, with Researchers failing to include this crucial component. The exception is the "Shrasthra" research, which addresses this gap by providing instruction on fundamental Sinhala sign phrases. This highlights the need for a strong foundation in core conversational skills and sentence structure, a gap that presents an opportunity for other studies or tools to include these essential lessons.</p>
                        <p>Another significant gap is the lack of quiz features is leaves learners without a means to assess their Sinhala competency or track their progress. Quizzes are instrumental in evaluating retention and reinforcing the subject matter. The presence of quizzes in "Shrasthra" highlights their importance as a self-evaluation tool. The absence of quizzes in other research projects underscores the need for more comprehensive learning tools.</p>
                        <p>Furthermore, the comparison of answers is notably absent, depriving learners of the opportunity to identify and rectify their mistakes and enhance their knowledge. "Shrasthra" stands out as the only tool offering this feedback mechanism. This gap in providing performance feedback presents an opportunity for other researchers to incorporate such features for improved learning experiences.</p>
